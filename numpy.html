    <p>NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful open-source Python library used for numerical and scientific computing. It introduces the ndarray, a fast and efficient<b> multi-dimensional array object that performs mathematical operations</b> much faster than regular Python lists. NumPy provides tools for <i>handling large datasets, performing vectorized operations, matrix calculations, statistical computations, linear algebra, Fourier transforms, and random number generation</i>.</p><p> Because of its speed and ability to work seamlessly with other libraries like<b> Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy, and Scikit-learn, NumPy forms</b> the foundation of most data science and machine learning workflows. It is widely used in <i>data analysis, numerical modeling, simulations, </i>and any application requiring high-performance mathematical processing.</P>
