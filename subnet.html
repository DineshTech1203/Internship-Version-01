    <p>Subnetting is a network technique used to <b>divide a large IP network into smaller, more manageable segments</b> called subnets.
         It helps improve network performance, security, and efficient IP address usage.</p> <p>In subnetting, <b>the IP address is split into a 
         network portion</b> and a host portion by using a <i>subnet mask, which determines how many devices</i> can exist within each subnet.</p><p>
         By creating <i><b>multiple smaller subnets, organizations can reduce broadcast traffic, isolate different departments, and organize their networks better.</b></i></P>
