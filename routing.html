    <h1>Networking Fumdamentals of Routing</h1>
    <center><img src="routing.jpg" alt="" width="200px"></center>

    <p>Routing is a core concept in network fundamentals that <b>deals with how data travels from one network to another</b>.
         When a device sends data<i> across a network, the information is broken into packets, and these packets must find the best path to reach the destination</i>.
         </p><p> This job is handled by a router, a network device that examines packet headers, checks routing tables, and decides the most efficient 
          route based on factors like network <b>congestion, distance, and available paths</b>.
           Routing ensures that data can move across multiple interconnected networks, such as from a <i>local home network to the global internet.</i></P>
