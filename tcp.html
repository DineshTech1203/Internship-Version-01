    <p>TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is one of the core communication protocols used in <b>computer networks, especially the internet.</b> 
        It provides <i>reliable, ordered, and error-checked</i> delivery of data between devices. When two computers communicate using TCP, 
        the protocol creates a stable connection known as a TCP connection through a process called the three-way handshake. 
        This ensures that both sender and receiver are ready before data transfer begins.</P>
    <h1>Internet Protocol (IP)</h1>

    <p>IP (Internet Protocol) is a fundamental networking protocol responsible for <b>identifying devices and routing data</b> across networks like the internet. 
        Every device connected to a network is<i> assigned a unique IP address, which acts like a digital home address, helping data packets</i> know where to go and where they came from. 
        IP works by breaking information into small packets and sending them independently through the best possible route to the destination.</p>
