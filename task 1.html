    <body>
        <P>A software developer is a professional who designs, builds, tests, and maintains software applications, websites, and systems using programming languages like Java, Python, C#, or JavaScript. Their main role is to understand user requirements, convert problems into solutions through logic, and write efficient code that runs smoothly. Software developers collaborate with designers, testers, and project managers to create functional and user-friendly applications. They also fix bugs, improve system performance, and update existing software. To become a software developer, a person needs strong problem-solving skills, logical thinking, and knowledge of programming, databases, and tools like Git. Most developers hold degrees in computer science, IT, or similar fields, but many enter the field through self-learning and coding practice. This profession offers strong career growth, high demand across industries, and attractive salaries, making it one of the most popular tech careers today.</P>
